# What is data journalism?

<!--
I could simply say that is journalism made with data. But that would not add that much. 

I believe if I give you a little bit of context and some examples it would make my job easier.

<!--
The concept that lead us to Data Journalism could be traced back to the idea of Precision Journalism.

In this book, Philip Meyer basically said to journalists: both science and journaoism are obcessed with the idea of truth.

In the book, he proposes that journalism starts to also follow some techniques used on social sciences.

<!--
That lead us to what was back then called Computer Assiting reporting:

In 1956, for example, CBS used for the first time a computer to try to predict the result of the US presidential election. 

So the idea of using computer and the scientific method was already around the newsrooms. 

But there were some problems

# Can you guess what happened?

<!--
Computers got more powerful, less expensive and a common thing in the newsroom;

Tools became easier to use - so the entry point was lower

And the idea of open public data became more present across the globe
